Vasya is a keen traveller, however the currency rates proved to be a real headache lately
It is also a bit of a trouble to keep monitoring things manually on a daily basis. 
One of Vasya's friends suggested a solution:
"Why don't you write a small utility program that will download the latest rates each day
from a RESTful web-service and do all the comparison automatically?"

"What's a web-service?", Vasya thought, "is it a web-site or something else? How do I
access it from my C# program?" Unfortunately web-services were not part of the programming
course at the time Vasya studied at HSE. Luckily things changed and now you can help
Vasya solve his problem.

Write a small graphical application that will query the exchange rate from RUB to a given
currency (entered in a textbox) for the last three days and print the trend as a string
with three possible values:
increasing, decreasing or unstable
